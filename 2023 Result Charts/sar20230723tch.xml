   <FOOTNOTES>HARD TO JUSTIFY broke in at the start and was corrected, tracked along the inside from mid pack, was on hold when MAKIA scraped the paint inside her at the half mile pole, got bumped by that rival and absorbed the blow bobbling the rival who dealt it, got forced to steady off heels as that rival took over her lane nudging her to the two path at the seven-sixteenths and lost two lengths of position and ground as a result with three furlongs to go, came under coaxing and bid powerfully nearing the quarter pole to swing six wide into upper stretch, rallied with good courage and energy to issue a challenge through the final sixteenth and was up in the final jumps to victory. APPELLATE just off the pace just off the inside tracking the front, tucked inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, rallied with good energy to take command a sixteenth from home, dug in between foes and was nailed in the final strides to the finish. SNOW DANCE forwardly placed three wide through the first turn, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, had SASSY PRINCESS attempt to lean out near the five-sixteenths from along her inside and denied the move holding her rightful lane, then got nudged out nearing the quarter pole by that same rival, swung three wide into upper stretch, took over command nearing the eighth pole and tussled with SASSY PRINCESS shaking off that foe when confronted and displaced from the front by the aforementioned foe, ran on willingly to secure the show honors. SASSY PRINCESS tracked the pace along the inside in aim of the front, came under light coaxing at the three-eighths and attempted to lean out and nudge SNOW DANCE to the three path and was denied the move by that rival, leaned out once more nearing the quarter pole and took over the two path pushing SNOW DANCE three wide, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive heads apart for command through to the sixteenth marker, then weakened in the very late stages. KATHERINE THOMAS three to four wide in pursuit from mid pack, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, improved position staying on one paced to the finish. LOOKS FIRST showed the way in hand along the inside patiently handled until put to coaxing near the quarter pole under challenge for the initial time, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front straightened away, dug in prominent to the furlong marker, then weakened through to the finish. SINTRA four then three wide through the first turn, chased three then two wide from just off the pace, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. MAKIA lunged at the break brushing the near side stall at the start and was away last, then had to steady briefly when crossing to the inside directly in behind UNDERTHEMISTLETOE conceding five to six lengths to the front before settling into stride, raced along the rail through the first turn taking up the tail of the field briefly before commencing a rush down the backstretch under coaxing into contention a half a mile from home, nudged HARD TO JUSTIFY off the rail scraping the paint inside that rival near the seven-sixteenths forcing that rival to steady and bobbling when making contact, came under a drive at the three-eighths along the inside, continued inside into upper stretch and tired having been spent. UNDERTHEMISTLETOE broke a beat slow when shying at the start, chased three then two wide until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. UNDER THE PALMS just off the inside near the rear of the field, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and made no impact.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>SLIP MAHONEY was carried out at the start while hustled, saved ground on the first turn, settled just off the pace, moved out while put to coaxing near the five-eighths, gained to make a bid outside of the leader at the nine-sixteenths, took the lead at the seven-sixteenths, vied in the two path on the far turn, remained on his inside lead while put to a drive in upper stretch, passed the furlong marker under a right-handed crop, swapped to the proper lead at the sixteenth-pole and proved best under a hand-ride to the wire. MOUNT UP was taken in hand after the start, went three wide early on the first turn, shifted to the four then five path late on that bend, settled off the pace, moved closer midway down the backstretch, stalked four then three wide on the final turn, was roused coming to the five-sixteenths, chased the winner under a drive past the eighth-pole and proved no match under a hand-ride in the final furlong but was well clear for the place. SET SAIL had his head-turned at the start and was off a bit slow, went three wide early on the first turn, angled out to the six path late on that bend, settled towards the back on the outside, moved in leaving the backstretch, was urged three then four wide on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive and lacked the needed response while clear for the show. WESTERN GHENT dropped from the five path to the three wide going around the first turn, tracked the pace down the backstretch, chased in the three path on the far turn and came up empty. LEDDY broke out then was corrected by the rider, raced inside on the first turn, settled off the pace, dropped back late on the backstretch, was urged along while inside to the two path on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. TOP SECRET went to the front, rounded the first turn in the two path, showed the way down the backstretch, lost the lead at the seven-sixteenths pole, dropped back inside on the far turn and capitulated.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>HOWDYOUMAKEURMONEY chased along the inside, was able to stay along the rail when a rival was pulling up midway on the turn, continued along the inside into upper stretch, tipped out five or six paths to the outside from behind a wall of foes stacked across the track a furlong out, then offered up a good finish surging late to get up in the final jumps and prevail. FONTANAFREDDA tossed her head and lunged at the start getting away last and conceding three to four lengths to the front, chased two to three wide, altered out to the four path briefly near the three-eighths around a pulling up rival, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command nearing the sixteenth marker, dug in and was nailed in the final few strides to the finish. ITSAKEYPER two to three wide in pursuit, tipped out altering around the pulling up foe near three furlongs to run, swung three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive running on willingly to secure the show honors. SOCIAL WHIRL two to three wide in pursuit, altered out around the pulling up rival near the midway point on the turn, tucked to the two path at the five-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. PALACE GOSSIP chased along the inside, inherited the front and remained along the rail when the initial leader was injured, took the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was caught inside the eighth pole, then weakened in the late going. BLAME IT ON MARY established the front and showed the way in hand three then two wide down the backstretch, was injured just inside the seven-sixteenths and lost action and was immediately placed to a firm protective hold and expertly pulled up in the two path backing up through the field and then guided outside to a stop near the five-sixteenths and was subsequently vanned off. Please note the half mile fraction was hand timed and provided by the stewards.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>NEST showed speed on the inside of a rival, was put under restraint then taken back off the pace in the two path early on the turn then shifted to the three path, tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid near the seven-sixteenths, vied in the three then four path on the final turn, took the advantage at the five-sixteenths, was roused while inching away at the quarter-pole then drifted inward in upper stretch, responded well under a brisk hand-ride in the final furlong and maintained a safe advantage to prevail. CLAIRIERE was coaxed from the gate then urged some outside two rivals early, tucked in behind a foe while put under restraint nearing the first turn, went three wide on that bend, settled just behind NEST on the backstretch, drafted two then three wide on the far turn, was asked while just off the heels of opponents inside the five-sixteenths, chased inside of NEST into the lane then angled outside of that foe as she drifted in at the three-sixteenths, pursued that one under a drive to the finish and was well clear for the place. SKRATCH KAT settled on the inside, was roused near the five-sixteenths, cut the corner against the rail into upper stretch and came up empty while best of the rest. PISTOL LIZ ABLAZEN was hustled from the gate, showed speed on the outside of the winner, moved clear while dropping from the three path to the two path on the first turn, showed the way down the backstretch, vied inside on the far turn, lost the advantage while roused at the five-sixteenths, dropped back outside the quarter-pole, came out into upper stretch and capitulated.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>SPANKHURST three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, swung three wide into upper stretch taking command straightened away, then drew clear under a drive to prevail. POPPY&apos;S PRIDE coaxed from the gate, dueled inside of PRINTRACK shortly after the start, took the inside route into upper stretch and was roused from the two path straightened away, kept on to chase the winner home clear for the place honors. CASH NOW stumbled at the start conceding two lengths to the front, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch and weakened while along for the show honors. THREE TWO ZONE broke out at the start bumping PRINTRACK, chased just off the inside until tucked inside half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled three wide for home and made no impact. PRINTRACK bumped at the start by the aforementioned foe breaking outwards, led early on and then dueled from the two path with POPPY&apos;S PRIDE to his inside, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>SAM&apos;S TREASURE moved up after the start then stalked the pace on the outside, made a bid with a half-mile to run, took a short lead in the four path on the turn, dropped to the three path into upper stretch then shook clear, was put to right-handed crop outside the furlong marker, switched to a left-handed crop and was given one pop while drawing away outside the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the finish. COLONIAL ROSE chased the early pace, steadied when foes crossed in front outside the five-eighths then dropped back, regained stride under urging, went four wide on the turn, chased the winner under a drive into the final furlong and safely secured the place. ALPINE PRINCESS bumped with a rival at the start then was taken up between horses, settled towards the rear under some urging, went four wide under stronger encouragement on the turn and was along for the show. LIFE&apos;S JOY broke in and brushed with a foe, angled in while going to the front, showed the way while in hand, was let out along the rail on the turn, lost the lead near the three-eighths pole, dropped back into upper stretch and tired. CANDY LOVER was hustled from the start, bumped with a rival outside the five-eighths pole then came back under urging, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn and came up empty. LOVE TO EAT bumped with a rival at the start, was well placed just off the pace, chased in the two path on the turn, dropped back while remaining on her inside lead in upper stretch and faded. MYSTICAL CHANT was urged along early, bumped with a foe outside the five-eighths then steadied some, moved out while dropping back shortly thereafter, went three wide on the turn, shifted five wide into the stretch and was no factor. ILIKEITLIKETHAT settled near the back under some urging, saved ground on the turn and failed to threaten. CAMERA broke in then stumbled after the start, settled at the rear on the outside, was caught six wide on the turn, dropped to the four path coming to the quarter-pole and never reached contention. CREDITOR was away awkwardly, settled off the pace, moved out near the nine-sixteenths, went five wide on the turn, dropped to the three path nearing the quarter-pole and capitulated.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>COLONEL BOWMAN chased three to four paths off the inside down the backstretch until tucked to the two path at the nine-sixteenths, chased just off the inside through the turn patiently handled and swung four wide into upper stretch, got roused straightened away, rallied to issue a challenge taking command near the sixteenth pole, then dug in holding safe from a late surging rival. LORD CAPTAIN broke out at the start bumping ROYAL TRYST and bobbled when making contact, chased five paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, went six wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and offered up a late surge to secure the place honors. CARAMEL CHIP four then three wide in aim of the leader, advanced to take command just inside the five-sixteenths, swung five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was directed inwards when COLONEL BOWMAN rallied to his inside to look that rival in the eye, got collared near the sixteenth marker and fought on to the finish well clear of the rest. LITTLE DEMON broke inwards brushing the near side stall at the start and was away last, came under light coaxing and advanced to take command shortly after the start, showed the way coaxed along three then two wide, yielded the front just inside the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened. ROYAL TRYST got bumped at the start by LORD CAPTAIN, crossed immediately to the two path thereafter, chased two to three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled six wide into upper stretch and trailed.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>R CALLI KIM was eager under restraint into the first turn, checked in the two path on that bend, was reserved towards the rear, traveled around the far turn in the two path, was roused four wide into the stretch then tipped further out at the three-sixteenths, rallied outside under a right-handed crop into the final furlong and closed strongly to get up late. CAFE FLEUR (FR) broke out at the start, angled in at the rear early, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the back, moved from the rail to the two path on the final turn, was roused at the quarter-pole, came under increasing urging in upper stretch, moved out near the furlong marker then went between foes and finished with good energy to just get the place. TASS bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground under tight restraint on the first turn, moved out early on the backstretch, tracked the pace under a very snug hold, made a bid outside the leader in the two path on the far turn, gained the advantage while set down into upper stretch, led under a drive into the final sixteenth but was overtaken then just lost the place while just able to get the show. STRONG ODOR bumped with a rival at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, was given her cue in the two path on the far turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, chased the leader in the drive and finished willingly to just miss the show. LINNY KATE was fractious in the gate, became rank under restraint nearing the first turn, checked along the rail on that bend, was well placed down the backstretch, saved ground on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths and lacked the needed response. PEACE SEEKER broke out at the start, moved in nearing the first turn, went three then four wide on that bend, settled on the outside but with the benefit of cover, raced three wide on the far turn, was roused five wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. SISTER ANNIE showed speed while in hand, fought the restraint of the rider in the two path on the first turn, showed the way while continuing to fight the rider some, was asked while inside on the final turn, lost the advantage into upper stretch and gave way. JACKIE THE JOKER rounded the first turn in the three path, stalked the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, dropped back five wide into the stretch and had nothing left. LUCKY PERIDOT went three then four wide on the first turn, settled on the outside but with the benefit of cover, was roused three wide on the far turn, dropped back six wide into the stretch and failed to respond.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>OCEAN&apos;S RESERVE chased five then four wide coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, took over command swinging five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command near the sixteenth pole, then edged away in the late stages to prevail. SCILLY CAY six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went eight wide into upper stretch and kicked on belatedly to just get up for the place honors in the last strides to the finish. MAJORITY PARTNER four then three wide in aim of the leader, tucked to the two path through the turn advancing to take command just outside the quarter pole, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive and was collared a sixteenth from home, ran on to preserve the show honors. BIG ENGINE chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, cut the corner into upper stretch, kept on to the finish. THRILL OF IT five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch, tucked three wide through the turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. MARKET ALERT chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six to seven wide into upper stretch, offered no response. WRITER&apos;S REGRET chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the turn, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. ANDIAMO A FIRENZE hard held three then two wide when eager off the heels of a rival down the backstretch, settled better through the turn chasing just off the inside and was placed to coaxing just past the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch between foes, dug in and lost her position between them and tipped out a path and tired to the finish.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>THREE GIRLS showed speed on the inside of a foe then dropped just off the pace, moved from the rail to the two path on the turn, was roused near the quarter-pole, rallied to the lead in upper stretch, shook clear outside the sixteenth-pole and proved best under steady urging. LADY BANKER angled in while going to the front, showed the way with a clear advantage, raced inside on the turn, was asked near the quarter-pole, lost the lead to the winner inside the three-sixteenths, fought with that foe until inside the furlong marker then was outfinished while just able to get the place. DANCE WITH ME BABE was fractious in the gate, moved in while settling off the pace, went around the turn in the two path, shifted three wide into the stretch, chased the top two in the drive and finished willingly to just miss the place but was clear for the show. RED BUTTERFLY was fractious in the gate then hustled from the start, chased the pace, saved ground on the turn and lacked the needed response. LAKESIDE GETAWAY was hustled from the gate, settled towards the rear, moved from three to five wide on the turn, came six wide into the stretch, was carried out near the furlong marker and improved position. MY CARA MIA MINE bumped with a rival at the start and was off a bit slow then dropped back while showing no speed, was urged near the back, raced inside to the two path on the turn, shifted four wide into the stretch, moved further out inside the three-sixteenths, bumped with an opponent late and failed to threaten. MO DAMORNINGGROUCH settled in the back half of the field, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch, was carried out while between foes near the furlong marker, bumped with a rival late and failed to rally. GIGGLING GHOST settled near the middle of the field, traveled around the turn in the two path, spun three wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. NEVER PERSONAL bumped with a rival at the start, was urged along on the outside, went three wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and failed to respond. DADDYSLILBOSSLADY settled off the pace, was taken in hand near the half-mile pole then dropped back leaving the backstretch, saved ground on the turn, moved out under a drive in upper stretch and lacked the needed kick. GOTHAM GRAY angled in while established a forward position early, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the two then three path on the turn and came up empty. ROXEN settled on the outside, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and showed little.</FOOTNOTES>
