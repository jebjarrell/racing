   <FOOTNOTES>GET SPOOLED broke out and bumped with a foe then was hustled, was bumped hard early and forced into another foe then checked, muscled his way to the front, showed the way on the inside, was asked outside the quarter-pole, swapped back to his inside lead when put to a right-handed crop at the furlong marker, switched back to the proper lead outside the sixteenth-pole then was put to a left-handed crop and held sway under strong urging. DANCING MISCHIEF came away from the gate awkwardly, was bumped and forced into another foe early then checked, tugged rankly on the bit into the first turn then checked again in the two path early on that bend, shifted to the three path shortly thereafter, settled off the pace, was roused two then three wide on the far turn, rallied five wide into the stretch, gained to loom a threat in the final furlong, drifted in while on his inside lead late and missed but was able to get the place. FROZEN FOUR leaned inward at the start, moved in while taken under a tight hold early, was reserved towards the rear in the two path, came under urging on the far turn, dropped to the rail and cut the corner into upper stretch, pursued the winner into the final sixteenth, swapped back to his inside lead late and finished with good courage for the show. B D SAINTS was bumped hard against the rail early then checked, became extremely rank and threw his head high in the air nearing the first turn under steadying restraint, checked again along the rail early on that bend, was rated on the inside, shifted three wide at the quarter-pole, was carried in then bumped with a rival near the three-sixteenths, clipped heels and checked yet again at that point, altered out for room in the final furlong, bobbled while lugging in some late and lost all chance in a horrific trip. UNAUDITED moved in early, traveled four then three wide on the first turn, tracked the pace on the outside, chased in the three path on the far turn, spun four wide into the stretch, drifted in near the three-sixteenths and bothered multiple foes, had B D SAINTS clip his heels at that point, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. SPECIALAGENTJONSON drifted in significantly after the start then bumped with a foe and bothered several opponents, was pulled off that skirmish to the outside by the rider, went three then two wide on the first turn, prompted the pace on the outside, was asked in the two path on the far turn, turned into upper stretch under a drive, was bumped near the three-sixteenths then checked and weakened. A KNIGHT&apos;S COURAGE broke out then was corrected by the rider, went three then four wide on the first turn, settled outside without cover, tucked in near the eleven-sixteenths then came back out, lugged out some while moving from the three path to the five path on the far turn and lacked the needed response. SCOOP THE POT angled in towards the rear early, settled on the inside, was roused on the far turn, turned into the stretch in the two path and failed to threaten. DILLON was bumped at the start and in a bit tight while last away, rounded the first turn in the two path, settled at the back on the outside, was urged along late on the backstretch, went four then three wide on the final turn and was no factor.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>INVISIBLE WAR hustled from the gate, raced along the inside through the first turn before taking to the four path down the backstretch while lightly coaxed along, advanced on the top pair five and a half furlongs out, chased just off the pace four wide through the far turn, went five wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge through the final furlong taking command nearing the sixteenth pole, then edged clear to the finish to prevail. UNION LIGHTS coaxed from the start, prompted the pace just off the inside through the first turn and then from the three path thereafter, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued three wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive between foes through to near the sixteenth marker, then got shaken off by the top one while engaged head to head to the finish with the former leader and kept on to secure the place honors in the final jumps. CUMBERLAND BLUES hustled from the gate, showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from UNION LIGHTS to the outside, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under threat from a pair and was collared nearing the sixteenth pole, then kept on head to head to the finish but was ultimately bested at the end for the place honors. BERT BERT BERT chased just off the inside coming under prolonged coaxing at the half mile pole, took the inside route into upper stretch, tired. CENTRAL PRIDE three then two wide through the first turn, chased four to five paths off the inside down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the far turn losing ground and growing detached at the tail of the field, continued just off the inside into upper stretch, folded, and was eased home through to the finish.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>IMPLEMENTATION was bumped on both sides at the start then checked while pinched back, settled on the outside, gained four wide on the turn, made a bid passing the five-sixteenths, battled outside of the runner-up into the final furlong then took a short lead and moved clear in the final sixteenth under strong urging. INEVTABL CONECTION moved in early while going to the front, lost the advantage at the eleven-sixteenths then tracked the new leader, was urged two to three wide on the turn, took the lead inside the five-sixteenths, battled inside of the winner under a drive into the final furlong then lost the advantage and was outfinished while well clear for the place. BIG VENEZUELA came inward while hustled from the start, established a good position down the backstretch, moved from the rail to the two path late on the turn, chased the top two under a drive into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. JESTER&apos;S SONG leapt in the air at the start and was off slow, spotted the front a few lengths, saved ground on the turn and failed to impact. PLAYINGWITHMATCHES was restless in the gate, bumped with rivals at the start, settled off the pace, was urged three then four wide on the turn and came up empty. LORD GATLING was bumped at the start and forced out, settled early then came under urging before the five-eighths pole, went three then two wide on the turn and failed to threaten. SAINTHOODFORBRIAN broke out at the start, settled between foes, was urged two then three wide on the turn, came out a bit more into the stretch and failed to respond. CAMM&apos; DUKE bumped with a rival at the start, moved up to take the lead at the eleven-sixteenths then moved clear, vied inside on the turn, was asked under threat at the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage outside the quarter-pole and faded.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>SUSPENDED CAMPAIGN saved ground near the rear of the field, steadily advanced along the rail, was unable to go up the inside and tipped out to be two then three wide just inside the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch, rallied to issue a challenge inside the final furlong and collared the leg weary leader seventy yards from home, then inched away to the finish to prevail. ITS COLD IN DEHERE five wide through the initial dog legged turn, chased five wide down the backstretch until tucked three wide at the half mile pole nudging R TENDERONI to the two path, advanced through the far turn to issue a challenge and take command inside the five-sixteenths, swung two to three wide into upper stretch, edged clear under a drive to the eighth pole, dug in under lone growing threat to the outside and grew leg weary and was caught in the final seventy yards to the finish while well clear of the rest for the place honors. RUN DEVIL established the front and showed the way in hand just off the inside under some pressure from TRADE SECRET to the outside, tucked inside into the far turn and came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front inside the five-sixteenths with the rider peeking back behind him when a pair of rivals threatened outside, took the inside route into upper stretch and weakened while clear for the show honors. TRADE SECRET broke out at the start bumping R TENDERONI, prompted the pace of RUN DEVIL from the outside three then two wide, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch and weakened. GREATEST LOVE chased three wide early on before tipping four to five wide down the backstretch, came under coaxing four to five wide three furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. R TENDERONI got bumped at the start by TRADE SECRET, who broke outwards, chased four wide until nudged to the two path half a mile from home, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and tired. THISLADYIS THE LAW chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, folded and was eased home to the finish.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>LET&apos;S GO BIG BLUE came away in good order, was placed under a snug hold while towards the front on the opening straightaway, set a joint pace on the inside of a foe while along the rail, responded well when asked at the quarter-pole, fought under a strong hand-ride in upper stretch, was put to a right-handed crop at the furlong marker, continued to battle inside of the runner-up, switched to a left-handed crop outside the sixteenth-pole and gamely prevailed under strong urging. GEM MINT TEN set a joint pace on the outside of a foe while in the two path, was given his cue on the final turn, dueled outside of the winner in the stretch and missed while clear for the place. MR. KRINGLE bumped with a rival at the start, was reserved on the inside, shifted three wide late on the far turn, swung five wide at the quarter-pole, was driven between foes in upper stretch and earned the show while no threat to the top two. THETHRILLOFVICTORY became keen when taken under restraint early, pulled hard while eager and inside to the two path on the first turn, was rated off the pace, saved ground on the far turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, turned into the stretch in the path and lacked the needed kick. TIMBUKTU was off a step slow and last to commence, went two then three wide on the first turn, was reserved on the outside but with some cover, went three then four wide on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. ONE HEADLIGHT rounded the first turn in the three path, was rated just off the pace, came under urging while between foes in the two path on the far turn, bumped with a rival and was steadied briefly while three wide into the stretch and also lacked the needed response. BLAME IT ON DADDY broke in and bumped with a foe, traveled three then four wide on the first turn, settled at the rear, was roused two then three wide on the far turn, swung five wide into the stretch and failed to rallly. EDDIE THE GREAT was hustled from the gate, went four wide on the first turn, stalked the pace on the outside without cover, chased three wide on the far turn, bumped with a foe into the stretch, dropped back into the final furlong and tired. NO REGARD traveled around the first turn in the two path, settled towards the rear, was roused between foes in the two path on the far turn and failed to respond.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>GALA BRAND saved ground near the rear of the field, remained patiently handled and swung four wide into upper stretch briefly paused, got roused straightened away at the three-sixteenths, tipped out a path from in behind HIDDEN CLASS, then got carried out two paths by that rival coming out before tipping further out to be eight or nine paths off the inside nearing the sixteenth marker while offering up a good finish to overhaul the leg weary leader seventy yards from home, then edged away to the end kept to task. HIDDEN CLASS got steadied at the start when LESLIE&apos;S LOOT broke inwards and bumped SHORESY, chased just off the inside from mid pack coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, drifted out two paths before being corrected and closed well to get up for the place honors in the final jumps to the wire. LESLIE&apos;S LOOT broke in at the start forcing HIDDEN CLASS to steady and brushing with SHORESY after that rival was bumped by HIDDEN CLASS, spurted away on the pace just off the inside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and continued just off the inside into upper stretch, dug in under a drive clear to the eighth pole but under growing threat to the outside, grew leg weary a sixteenth out and was overhauled by the top one seventy yards from the finish, then got caught by the runner up in the final jumps while able to salvage the show honors. DESTINY STAR got brushed at the start by SHORESY due to pressure outside from LESLIE&apos;S LOOT, chased inside down the backstretch and then just off the inside through the turn coaxed along from the five-sixteenths, swung three wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. KHOZY COLBY three wide in pursuit isolated between the spurting away leader and the rest of the field in behind, came under coaxing near the quarter pole and swung four wide into upper stretch, stayed on one paced to the finish and was outfinished in the late stages. TEMPTING LADY brushed the near side stall at the start, chased four wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, angled seven to eight wide for home and improved position to the finish. GOATS ON A TREE struck the off side stall at the start, chased four then three wide down the backstretch before tucking to the two path through the turn, angled five wide into upper stretch and made some ground while making no positional headway. MO TWILIGHT coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled six wide into upper stretch and made no impact. BAYTOWN KITTY CAT coaxed from the start, chased three wide under coaxing from the three-eighths, angled four to five wide into upper stretch and weakened. SHORESY got bumped askew at the start by HIDDEN CLASS who came inwards and steadied due to pressure from LESLIE&apos;S LOOT breaking inwards, chased along the inside under a ride from the five-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, tired.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>I&apos;MHAVINGAMOMENT bumped with a rival at the start, showed speed then pressed the pace on the outside, vied in the three to four path on the turn, was asked nearing the quarter-pole, took over into upper stretch then kicked clear, remained clear under a drive into the final sixteenth then was eased up while much the best. SECURITY CODE broke a bit awkwardly, was taken under rtght restraint early then rated off the pace, went three wide while asked on the turn, chased the winner in the stretch and was second best. RIBOT&apos;S VALENTINE was hustled from the gate, showed the way under pressure to her outside, dropped from the two path to the rail early on the turn, was asked under threat on that bend, lost the advantage into upper stretch and weakened but held the show. TEMPERMENTAL was reserved off the pace, moved in near the nine-sixteenths, was let out three wide on the turn then driven five wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. OK HONEY was hustled from the gate then urged along off the pace, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, saved ground on the turn, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. DIVA BANKER bumped with a rival at the start, settled off the pace, moved closer near the nine-sixteenths, chased in the two path through the turn and tired. CINDERELLA&apos;S CAUSE was hustled from the gate then ridden along on the outside, went five then six wide on the turn and failed to respond. HAPPY SOPHIA was forwardly placed on the outside, dropped back late on the backstretch, came up empty while four then five wide on the turn and faltered.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>BOLD ENDEAVOR chased four then three wide advancing on the top pair three furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths and swung four to five wide into upper stretch, took over command at the three-sixteenths and inched away under a drive to prevail. GUNTOWN chased along the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, angled out and ran on in tandem with MYSTIC NIGHT and just bested that rival for the place honors. MYSTIC NIGHT chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, dug in under a drive latched on the aforementioned foe offering up a mild bid through to the finish but was ultimately bested for the place honors while along for the show. RUGGS showed the way in hand from the three path, tucked to the two path and vied between foes through the far turn getting headed for command with five-sixteenths to go, swung three then two wide into upper stretch, weakened in the late stages. GALT brushed the near side stall at the start, chased five then four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened. PIPELINE prompted the pace of RUGGS from the inside in the two path, tucked inside into the turn and advanced to vie taking command narrowly over a pair five-sixteenths from home, spun along the inside route into upper stretch, yielded the front with three-sixteenths to go and weakened.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>MCKULICK (GB) settled off the pace while inside to the two path, raced tightly bunched between foes in the three path into the final turn then dropped back, was roused in the two path in the vicinity of the five-sixteenths, rallied in upper stretch, closed well into the final furlong, moved out while gaining approaching the sixteenth-pole and got up late to prevail. WAR LIKE GODDESS became extremely rank along the rail on the opening bend, threw her head high in the air under steadying restraint, remained very rank for the opening half-mile pole, was rated under a vigorous hold along the rail on the second turn, raced off the inside down the backstretch, steadied off heels at the three-eighths while dropping back to the rail, moved back to the two path outside the quarter-pole, was let out into the stretch, made a bid outside of the leader at the three-sixteenths, gained a short lead inside the furlong marker, led into the final sixteenth but was caught while clear for the place. AMAZING GRACE (GER) was asked some leaving the gate, settled on the inside through the first two turns, remained towards the back down the backstretch, bumped with a foe in the two path while between horses at the three-eighths and checked, lost lots of ground on the leaders in the process, was roused in the two path on the final turn, chased under a drive in the stretch and finished willingly to just get the show. SOPRAN BASILEA (IRE) was reserved in the two path while given cover, was asked four wide on the final turn, chased under a drive in the stretch and just missed the show then suffered an injury on the gallop-out and was euthanized on the course. VERGARA was taken under a tight hold early, stalked outside in the three path through the first two turns, took the lead outside the five-eighths pole, dropped in leaving the backstretch, vied inside on the final turn, was asked at the quarter-pole then came under a drive in upper stretch, lost the lead to the runner-up inside the furlong marker and weakened then was just caught for the superfecta. VIRGINIA JOY (GER) tracked the pace on the outside in the two path, moved out midway down the backstretch, was asked with a half-mile to run, chased two then three wide on the third turn, pursued the leaders under a drive into the final furlong and tired. ELEGANT TASTE moved in while going to the front, showed the way on the inside while in hand, was headed outside the five-eighths, dropped back late on the backstretch, bumped with a foe at the three-eighths pole and stopped then was eased in the stretch but walked off.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>P MONEY knocked heads with BANKINGONACHANCE from the two path before shaking off that rival to establish sole command near the seven-sixteenths, showed the way through the turn tucked to the inside and was placed to coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, dug in under a drive under threat a furlong out, repelled that challenge to edge clear to the finish kept busy to the end. RIPE FOR MISCHIEF chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled four wide into upper stretch, offered up a bid to challenge a furlong out, then got rebuffed by the top one while keeping on to secure the place honors. WHISKEY AND WINE broke last when getting away to a hesitant start and conceded three to four lengths to the front, chased just off the inside patiently handled until let out angled three to four wide into upper stretch, ran on to secure the show honors. BANKINGONACHANCE dueled inside of P MONEY early on before easing off near the seven-sixteenths to chase along the inside through the turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. SPOOFY stumbled after the start and conceded three lengths to the front, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. ACADEMY CHOICE chased along the inside under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch, weakened. SINALOA coaxed from the gate, chased four paths off the inside until tucked to the two path into the turn, got coaxed along three furlongs from home, angled five to six wide into upper stretch and weakened. THE GOLDEN ONE got bumped after the start by SPOOFY when that foe recovered from a stumble and was forced to take hold as SINALOA took over the lane in front, conceded four to five lengths to the leader before settling into to stride, chased five to six paths off the inside down the backstretch and then three wide through the turn under coaxing from the three-eighths, went seven wide into upper stretch and weakened.</FOOTNOTES>
