   <FOOTNOTES>OZARA (IRE) tucked inside soon after the start and settled in pursuit along the inside from mid pack through the first turn, pulled a bit keen near the nine-sixteenths, moving to be just off the pace into the far turn, remained along the inside through that bend and spun just off the inside into upper stretch briefly awaiting clearance as SMOOTH WAVES drifted in slightly, got clearance with three-sixteenths to go and was roused on through splitting foes to take command nearing the eighth pole, inched away before coming under growing late threat to the outside, came out slightly to look her main danger in the eye, the rider flashing the crop to the off side and repelled the challenge to the wire. WEIGH THE RISKS brushed the near side stall at the start getting away slow and conceding five lengths to the front before settling into stride, raced two to three wide through the first turn, chased two to three wide down the backstretch before tucking inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch, rallied with good energy through to just inside the sixteenth marker, then had the crop of the rider of OZARA getting flashed out in front of her and finished with more trepidation getting rebuffed at the end. IT&apos;S HOT IN HERE (IRE) coaxed from the gate, chased along the inside through the first turn and then three then two wide down the backstretch, came under light coaxing at the seven-sixteenths and raced just off the inside through the far turn, went five wide into upper stretch, ran on through to the finish to secure the show honors. LATER DARLING dwelt at the start getting away last and conceding seven to eight lengths to the front before settling into stride, raced along the inside through the first turn before taking to the three path into the backstretch, tucked to the two path midway before heading back inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, angled out six wide into upper stretch, rallied and was forced to pause and alter out slightly near the sixteenth marker and foes in front drifted, kept on with good courage to secure the last major share. SMOOTH WAVES three then two wide through the first turn, prompted the leader from the two path coming under coaxing near the five-sixteenths, spun two to three wide into upper stretch, took over narrow and brief command at the three-sixteenths, got headed near the eighth pole and weakened in the late stages. GOLDEN GHOST (GB) four then three wide through the first turn, chased three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and weakened in the late going. BACKSTRETCH ROSE reluctant to load prior to the start, raced just off the inside through the first turn, chased four then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, went seven wide into upper stretch and offered no response. KINGDOM COME broke slow conceding five lengths to the front, chased along the inside, pulled keenly midway down the backstretch and continued along the inside through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, continued in the inside route into upper stretch and weakened in the late stages. CARINA NEBULA coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside through the first turn, then chased three to four wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, swung six wide for home, weakened in the stretch. SANDS OF WAR coaxed from the gate, showed the way in hand along the inside under some pressure from SMOOTH WAVES to the outside, came under coaxing near the quarter pole, took the inside route into upper stretch and yielded near the three-sixteenths, then tired through to the finish.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>WAYS AND MEANS broke in and bumped hard with a rival, was rated just off the pace while into the bit, drafted in the two path early on the turn then shifted to the four path, rallied coming to the quarter-pole, closed fast in the five path to take the lead into upper stretch then was shaken up briefly, kicked clear impressively shortly thereafter with the rider becoming motionless in the saddle and powered away in the final furlong with the rider poised like a statue in the irons to win handily. CALLE AMADA was carried in at the start, moved up under urging to race just off the pace then was taken in hand, saved ground just behind the leader on the turn, tried to come through along the rail into upper stretch but didn&apos;t have enough room, steadied in tight against the rail then altered out significantly near the furlong marker and safely secured the place. VALUE AREA was carried in at the start, moved up to get the lead outside the five-eighths, dropped from the two path to the rail on the turn, vied inside of two foes on that bend, lost the advantage into upper stretch and weakened while able to hold the show. BENTO settled just the pace on the outside, made a bid while four then three wide on the turn, drifted inward in upper stretch and tired. MANAGING MISCHIEF broke fast then angled in while sent hard, lost the lead outside the five-eighths pole then chased the pace, engaged the leader in the three then two path on the turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. NORISKIT NOBISCUIT was ridden along on the outside, moved in leaving the backstretch, went two to three wide on the turn, spun four wide into the stretch, moved out in the drive and failed to threaten. SHORE WAR broke in and hit the gate, dropped back between foes then climbed outside the five-eighths, saved ground on the turn and was no factor. SIX PACK SENORITA was reluctant to load, came away at the rear while bumped hard and forced in, drifted out inside the five-eighths pole, went four wide on the turn, came five wide into the stretch and also was no factor.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>MISS DOMINA chased three then two wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled five wide into upper stretch, rallied to take command a sixteenth from home, inched away to the finish kept to task. U SHOULD B DANCING chased just off the inside coming under coaxing near the quarter pole, angled six wide into upper stretch, rallied willingly to chase the winner home while safe for the place honors. CHROMEPLATED HEART led briefly early on before chasing just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, angled four wide into upper stretch, seized command just inside the three-sixteenths, dug in under threat and was collared a sixteenth out, kept on to preserve the show honors. DUFRESNE chased three to four wide until tucked inside at the seven-sixteenths, came under coaxing three furlongs from home, swung four wide into upper stretch and offered up a mild kick. ROJA LIGERA chased three wide until tucked inside with seven-sixteenths to go, came under light coaxing at the five-sixteenths, got set down spinning two to three wide into upper stretch, weakened. CROWDING OUT coaxed from the gate, briefly tussled with CHROMEPLATED HEART before taking over the front with nine-sixteenths to go, showed the way in hand along the inside, got let out under challenge spinning just off the inside into upper stretch, yielded the front just inside the three-sixteenths and tired.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>WHATLOVELOOKSLIKE stalked the pace on the outside in the two to three path, was asked on the final turn, took the lead in upper stretch and drew clear under good handling. FEDERALIST PAPERS dropped well behind early, settled at the rear while inside to the two path, was asked on the final turn, paused to avoid a fallen foe outside the quarter-pole, shifted three wide into the stretch, pursued the leader into the final furlong, swapped back to her inside lead at the sixteenth-pole and got up for the place. MYRISKYAFFAIR settled while inside to the two path, moved closer with a half-mile to run, was asked on the third turn, steadied while near the fallen foe outside the quarter-pole, spun four wide into the stretch, chased outside into the final furlong and lacked the needed kick. ENSEMBLE (IRE) was hustled to the front, showed the way in hand while inside to the two path, was asked inside the five-sixteenths, lost the advantage to the winner in upper stretch and gave way. EVER SUMMER settled on the outside while traveling three to four wide, was asked on the final turn, suffered an injury outside the quarter-pole and fell then was euthanized on the course. FRIVOLE (FR) was taken in hand nearing the first turn then reserved on the inside, pulled up on the second turn and was vanned off.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>BURGEE attended the leader from the outside three then two wide advancing to take command near the five-sixteenths placed to coaxing, swung two to three wide into upper stretch under challenge to the outside, dug in dueling through the stretch to the finish in game fashion to prevail at the end. DURKIN&apos;S CALL four then three wide in pursuit, advanced on the top pair and was set down spinning four wide into upper stretch, dug in dueling through the stretch to the finish gamely outside the aforementioned foe but was ultimately denied at the finish. HAMMERIN AAMER coaxed from the gate, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch, improved position to secure the show honors. GOLDINI chased along the inside and then just off the inside coming under coaxing three furlongs from home, angled six wide into upper stretch, passed tired rivals. SOUPER CATCH coaxed from the gate, chased just off the inside until tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and weakened. GRUMPS LITTLE TOTS three wide in pursuit, came under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths, swung four to five wide into upper stretch, weakened. JUMPSTER chased along the inside growing detached at the tail of the field early on, came under coaxing with seven-sixteenths to go, cornered just off the inside into upper stretch and made no impact. SPRINKLEHEAD showed the way in hand just off the inside under the watchful eyes of BURGEE to the outside, tucked inside into the far turn, came under coaxing at the three-eighths, yielded the front near five-sixteenths remaining, took the inside route into upper stretch and folded.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>EMPIRE ISLAND was well placed just off the pace, saved ground while asked on the turn, turned into the stretch in the two path, chased the leader into the final furlong, gained to make a bid near the sixteenth-pole and got up under good handling to prevail. LADY MOSCATO tracked the pace on the outside, made a bid in the three path on the turn, took the lead coming to the quarter-pole, inched clear under a right-handed crop in upper stretch, remained on her inside lead while clinging to the front into the final sixteenth and was caught while clear for the place. BEFORE YOU GO GO was urged along on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch, pursued the top two into the final furlong, moved in outside the sixteenth-pole and weakened while able to get the show. RUBY QUEEN was urged along on the outside, went five then four wide on the turn, pursued the leaders into the final furlong, drifted in late and lacked the needed kick. HELCIA was urged along towards the rear, went three wide on the turn and failed to respond. GYPSY TALES broke in at the start, went to the front then showed the way with a clear advantage, was challenged while in the two path on the turn, came under urging outside the five-sixteenths, lost the lead approaching the quarter-pole and faltered. AMERICA&apos;S VOW was ridden along off the pace, went four wide on the turn, spun five wide into the stretch and came up empty. PHILANTHROPY broke a step slow then was taken up, spotted the front several lengths, was urged at the rear, saved ground for most of the turn, shifted three wide late on that bend, came four wide into the stretch and failed to threaten. HOLIDAY ROAD was urged along off the pace, went around the turn in the two path and had nothing left.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>CANT KEEP ME DOWN hustled from the gate, chased three wide coming under coaxing at the five-sixteenths, angled three to four wide into upper stretch, took over command straightened away and edged clear under a drive to prevail. IT WASN&apos;T ME chased just off the inside in closest aim of the leader, advanced to take command seven-sixteenths from home, came under coaxing near the quarter pole under challenge, took the inside route into upper stretch, got collared straightened away and ran on well clear of the rest to be along second best. VOLATILITY chased three to four wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung four wide into upper stretch, kept on to the finish, the rider looking back a sixteenth out and gearing down his charge in the late stages to the wire unable to catch the direct rival in front while safely along for the show honors. WICKSIEPIXIE got briefly steadied at the start when her lane was taken over by a rival and conceded four lengths to the front, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, swung four wide into upper stretch and passed tired rivals. AVALANCHE IS COMIN coaxed from the gate, got bumped between foes near the seven-eighths when POSITIVE MESSAGE angled out as BELLESHAZZA squeezed herself in on the rail, got knocked askew into CANT KEEP ME DOWN, chased four then three wide coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five to six wide into upper stretch and tired. BELLESHAZZA hustled from the gate, chased just off the inside coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung three wide for home and tired. GET RESPECT showed the way in hand along the inside coming under coaxing at the seven-sixteenths when headed for the front, chased along the inside through the turn and into upper stretch, then faltered in the drive. POSITIVE MESSAGE (GB) bobbled at the break, chased just off the inside and had BELLESHAZZA dart to the rail and altered out bumping AVALANCHE IS COMIN into CANT KEEP ME DOWN, chased two wide down the backstretch and through the far turn coming under brief coaxing at the seven-sixteenths when losing ground, got eased up and went six to seven wide into upper stretch, then got pulled up when met by the outrider near the sixteenth marker before walking off under her own power.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>BRIGHTWORK bobbled at the start, showed speed then was well placed just off the pace, went two then three wide on the turn, was asked near the five-sixteenths, rallied four wide into the stretch, took the lead outside of two opponents at the three-sixteenths and drew away under steady urging. HERE U COME AGAIN showed good speed, set the pace under pressure to her outside, vied in the two path on the turn, was asked approaching the quarter-pole, lost the advantage under a drive in upper stretch and proved no match for the winner while clear for the place. STREAMING NOW pressed the pace on the outside then in the three path on the turn, was given her cue near the five-sixteenths, dropped closer to the two path late on the bend, turned into upper stretch on even terms for the lead, dropped back into the final furlong and weakened but held the show. MAGIC CROSS was bumped at the start and forced in, moved up to established a good position down the backstretch, saved ground while asked on the turn, shifted three wide into the stretch and lacked the needed response. PRINCESS INDY bumped with a rival at the start, dropped well behind early, went around most of the turn in the two path, angled four wide outside the quarter-pole, came five wide into the stretch then moved further out and failed to threaten. PRINCESA CELINA bumped with a foe at the start, angled to the outside early then was urged along, dropped back five wide under a slight bit of extra left-rein pressure on the turn, was roused six wide at the quarter-pole then carried out , remained on her inside lead past the furlong marker and failed to respond. BECKY&apos;S JOKER leaned out at the break and was last away, settled on the outside, was urged four then three wide on the turn, came under stronger encouragement outside the five-sixteenths, spun four wide into the stretch then moved further out and also failed to respond. COPPER EM was hustled from the gate, tracked the pace on the outside, chased four wide on the turn, dropped back late on that bend and capitulated.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>RUDA coaxed from the gate, led early on before being headed for command six furlongs from home, chased along the inside in range, came under coaxing and advanced to come again three furlongs out taking back the front, spun just off the inside into upper stretch, went clear under a drive to prevail. PENTAGON coaxed from the start, chased two to three wide under coaxing from the five-sixteenths, swung three to four wide for home, proved no match for the top one while clear of the rest for the place honors. CAN&apos;T FOOL ME chased two to three wide until tipped four wide through the far turn coming under coaxing at the three-eighths, swung five wide into upper stretch and weakened. MISS KRISTY got bumped at the start by UP HER SLEEVE, chased three to four wide under coaxing from the seven-sixteenths, spun just off the inside into upper stretch and tired. UP HER SLEEVE broke out at the start bumping MISS KRISTY, raced just off the inside in closest aim of the leader before advancing to take command six furlongs from home, came under coaxing at the three-eighths when displaced from the front, cut the corner into upper stretch and tired.</FOOTNOTES>

   <FOOTNOTES>FORWARD MOVE bumped with a rival at the start, went to the front, showed the way on the inside of a rival while inside to the two path, was asked on the far turn, came under a right-handed crop while remaining on his inside lead in upper stretch, continued on his inside lead under the crop until just before the sixteenth-pole then was placed under a hand-ride to the wire while best. UNAFFECTED was bumped hard early, went three then two wide on the first turn, settled off the pace, raced inside early on the far turn, angled three then four wide later on that bend, came five wide into the stretch and got up for the place. SILENT RUNNING stumbled at the start then bumped with a foe, was forced out early, went five then four wide on the first turn, settled well off the pace, was urged along in the two path on the far turn and improved for the show. PRIX DE WEST shied out early, dropped from the five path to the three path on the first turn, moved up to prompt the pace on the outside, was asked in the three path on the far turn, dropped back in upper stretch and tired. MUNNY FOR NUTHIN checked sharply at the start, went three wide on the first turn, settled towards the rear, moved from three to five wide under urging on the far turn, came six wide into the stretch and improved position but just missed the superfecta. FAST STUDY was bumped on both sides at the start, went six then five wide on the first turn, was rated on the outside, traveled three wide under urging on the far turn and lacked the needed response. ZAPRUDER bumped with a rival at the start, was carried out early, dropped from the six path to the three path on the opening bend, moved closer midway down the backstretch, chased inside on the far turn, spun three wide into the stretch and came up empty. STOW ON THE WOLD bumped with a rival at the start, saved ground under urging on the first turn, settled in fourth position, moved out inside the five-eighths pole, chased four wide on the far turn and weakened. IN MY SHADOW broke out and bumped with a rival, saved ground on the first turn, settled at the rear, went two then three wide on the far turn and was no factor. GIO&apos;S MAJESTICNESS was hustled from the gate, came out and bumped hard with a foe early, went three wide on the first turn, dropped back on the backstretch and retreated then was eased in the stretch but walked off.</FOOTNOTES>
